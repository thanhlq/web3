## What's Included

Todo

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm install`: install the dependencies needed for each package.
- `pnpm build`: transpile the local TypeScript packages to JavaScript.
- `pnpm build:watch`: transpile the local TypeScript packages to JavaScript, and watch for changes.
- `pnpm check:exports`: check that the `exports` field in the `package.json` files of each exported package is correctly set, using [`@arethetypeswrong/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arethetypeswrong/cli).
- `pnpm lint:ci`: check that the code follows the `biome` guidelines.
- `pnpm lint`: check that the code follows the `biome` guidelines, and override it to follow them if possible.
- `pnpm test:unit`: run unit tests.
- `pnpm test:integration`: run integration tests.
- `pnpm test`: run all tests.

## Test Structure

We follow an opinionated convention for storing an running tests.
All tests should be written in the `__tests__` directory of a local package.
Moreover, unit tests should be placed in the `__tests__/unit` folder; similarly, integration tests should be placed in the `__tests__/integration` folder.
This allows for easily running groups of tests (for instance, you might want to run unit tests locally, while deferring integration tests - that will probably need access to external services like Docker containers - to the CI only).
