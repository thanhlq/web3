# kaspa wasm nodejs binding library

I don't see the official npm for kaspa wasm nodejs binding library.

That's  why I create this repo to help you to use kaspa wasm nodejs binding library.

## Installation

- The version 1.0.0 is equipvalent to kaspa latest release 1.0.0

(I try to keep the version number same as kaspa release version)
